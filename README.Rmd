# ferret

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ferret is to provide an easy way to open a lot of documents very fast. I tend to use "Find in files" a lot, but I don't like how I have to click on each instance. This packages tries to alleviate my overwhelming problems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ferret like so:

``` r
pak::pak("emilhvitfeldt/ferret)
```

## Example

I expect all use-cases are handled with the and only function `ferret::file_find()` that takes a vector of file names

```{r example}
fs::dir_ls("R/") |> ferret::file_find("useMethod")
```
